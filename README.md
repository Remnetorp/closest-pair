Program to calculate closest distance between two Points, with x and y coordinates. 

----------------------------------------------------------------
The syntax of the input files the program reads is the following:
The first line of input consists of a single integer, the amount of points.
Then follow N lines, the i-th line containing two integers, the x- and y-coordinates for each point. 
<br>
To run the algorithm, use following lines: <br>
(1) $ javac ClosestPair.java Point.java <br>
(2) $ java ClosestPair < data-input/data4.in <br>
(3) $ java ClosestPair < data-input/data12.in output <br>
