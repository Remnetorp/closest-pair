Program to calculate closest distance between two coordinates. 

----------------------------------------------------------------
The syntax of the input files the program reads is the following:
The first line of input consists of a single integer, 2 ≤ N ≤ 106 , the amount of coordinates.
Then follow N lines, the i-th line containing two integers, the x- and y-coordinates.
